## About Me
I got acquainted with HTML during my school years: while my classmates were learning how to make Power Point presentations, I was writing markup and styles in text editor notepad. Back then I didn’t become a Front-end developer.

I have learned a lot over the last 10 years: from carpentry to transport management, from music to photography. I'm an all-rounder and always eager to learn something new. Now I want to become a Front-end developer, as it will allow me to be part of cool teams, have mobility in my work and create products that millions of people will use.
